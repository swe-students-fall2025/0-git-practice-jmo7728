An article that I found interesting, which was recommended to me during my internship is ["What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory"](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf) By Ulrich Drepper who is the CTO of Red Hat.

What I find interesting about this article is how important low-level details about memory can be influential to our software development. The systems I worked with were coded heavily with C and had to be extremely careful with memory. Before this article I only understood a basic level of how memory works from a low level perspective from Computer Systems Orginization, but this article expanded my knoweldge, and influenced my software development approach. The errors I encounter start to make a lot more sense, and I am now able to understand how to better optimize my code and leverage new topics such as multi-threaded programming.
